# hello-world
Creating hello-world repository per GitHub's Guide to store ideas for projects. Currently will be focused on Python.

Hiya, my name is Cliff Novak. I'm beginning to learn to code. I originally started with JavaScript, learning on 'Watch and Code' as well as doing FlatIron's bootcamp prep for JavaScript. After playing with JS for about 2 months, I've decided that Python is more my speed as I have always gravitated towards math. Also, charts are fun.
